# Math Notes

## Factoring

### Greatest Common Factor

20 -> 4 * 5
5 is prime.
4 -> 2 * 2
2 is prime.

So 20 is 5 * 2 * 2.

## Logarithms

To calculate substraction such as log(2)8 - log(2)2. You have divide 8 by 2, so the answer is log(2)4. Writing a log as an exponential such as log(2)4 = y is 2^y = 4.

## Geometry

Points- a point in space
Segments- two connecting points in a line (no direction)
Lines- Extends infinity in both directions
Rays- Extends infinity in one direction
Angles - Represented by a <. Can be multiple angles, so <BAC.

To indicate the length of a line segement use mAB, which equals |a-b| or |b-a|.

The midpoint of a line segment is calculated by (x1 - x2) / 2, (y1 - y2) / 2.

To find the slope use ∆y / ∆x, so (-1 - 3) / (-3 - 3) = 2/3.

## Trigonometry

Only applies to right triangles.

Sin - Opposite / Hypotenuse
Cos - Adjacent / Hypotenuse
Tan - Opposite / Adjacent

The side that comes together to make the theta angle is the adjacent side. Opposite is the opposite from theta.

To rationalize a fraction multiply by the dominator (i.e. sqrt(3)).

sin(45) = sqrt(2) / 2
cos(45) = sqrt(2) / 2
tan = 1

Because adjacement and opposite will be 45 degrees and will have a 90 degree angle, the answer will always be equal to this because the sides width/heights are the same.

For a 30-60-90 triangle. Hypotenuse is always 2x, adjacent is x, and opposite is x sqrt(3).

sin(30) = 1 / 2
cos(30) = sqrt(3) / 2
tan(30) = 1 / sqrt(3)

sin(60) = sqrt(3) / 2
cos(60) = 1 / 2
tan(60) = sqrt(3)

sec - opposite of cosine (1/cos)
csc - opposite of sin (1/sin)
cot - opposite of tan (1/tan)
