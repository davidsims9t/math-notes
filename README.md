# Math Notes

## Factoring

### Greatest Common Factor

20 -> 4 * 5
5 is prime.
4 -> 2 * 2
2 is prime.

So 20 is 5 * 2 * 2.

## Algebra

### Logarithms

To calculate substraction such as log(2)8 - log(2)2. You have divide 8 by 2, so the answer is log(2)4. Writing a log as an exponential such as log(2)4 = y is 2^y = 4.

### Inequalities

Whenever you divide by a negative number you have to flip the less-than or greater than sign.

## Geometry

Points- a point in space
Segments- two connecting points in a line (no direction)
Lines- Extends infinity in both directions
Rays- Extends infinity in one direction
Angles - Represented by a <. Can be multiple angles, so <BAC.

To indicate the length of a line segement use mAB, which equals |a-b| or |b-a|.

The midpoint of a line segment is calculated by (x1 - x2) / 2, (y1 - y2) / 2.

To find the slope use ∆y / ∆x, so (-1 - 3) / (-3 - 3) = 2/3.

Parallel, perpendicular, or neither are determined by the slope.
When the slopes are equal, then the lines are parallel.
When the first slope is 0 and the second is undefined, then the lines are perpendicular.
Neither is when the slope is not equal or the opposite.

To find the distance use D = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
To find the 3d distance use D = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2)

Conditional: If-then statement
Hypothesis: The condition
Conclusion: The result

## Trigonometry

Only applies to right triangles.

Sin - Opposite / Hypotenuse
Cos - Adjacent / Hypotenuse
Tan - Opposite / Adjacent

The side that comes together to make the theta angle is the adjacent side. Opposite is the opposite from theta.

To rationalize a fraction multiply by the dominator (i.e. sqrt(3)).

sin(45) = sqrt(2) / 2
cos(45) = sqrt(2) / 2
tan = 1

Because adjacement and opposite will be 45 degrees and will have a 90 degree angle, the answer will always be equal to this because the sides width/heights are the same.

For a 30-60-90 triangle. Hypotenuse is always 2x, adjacent is x, and opposite is x sqrt(3).

sin(30) = 1 / 2
cos(30) = sqrt(3) / 2
tan(30) = 1 / sqrt(3)

sin(60) = sqrt(3) / 2
cos(60) = 1 / 2
tan(60) = sqrt(3)

sec - opposite of cosine (1/cos)
csc - opposite of sin (1/sin)
cot - opposite of tan (1/tan)

### Compliments

If you have a negative angle, you won't be able to find the compliment or in other words it doesn't exist.

To find the compliment of an angle, it must equal to 90 degrees. So if you have π/6 then the complementary angle would be π/3. Since π/2 - π/6 = 3π/6 - π/6 = 2π/6 = π/3.

For the supplementary angle, you use π - π/6 = 6π/6 - π/6 = 5π/6.

### Converting to DMS

1 degree = 60' (minutes) or 3600" (seconds).

### Converting to Radians

Multiple the degree by (2π/360) or (π/180) to get the result in radians. To get degrees multiply by (180/π) or (360/2π) to get the degree measure. 1 = (180/π). (π/180) = 1.

### Sketching the Arc on a Unit Circle

t = 12. (12 / 2π) = (6 / π) = 1.91. 0.91 * 360 = 328.

### Parametric Curves

Eliminating the parameter.

You can write x = 3 cos(t) as cos(t) = x/3.
y = 3 sin(t).
X is adjacent and 3 is the hypotenuse.
So x^2 + b^2 = 9. b = sqrt(9 - x^2).
Y = 3 (sqrt(9 - x^2) / 3) or y = sqrt(9 - x^2).
y ^ 2 = 9 - x^2 or x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 = 9.
Therefore, x = 3, y = 0.
Since 3 cos(0) = 3 and 3 sin(0) = 0.

### Area of Circular Sectors

A = (1/2) (100)^2 (5π/4)
A = (50,000π/8) = 6250π
