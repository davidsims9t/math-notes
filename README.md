# Math Notes

## Factoring

### Greatest Common Factor

20 -> 4 * 5
5 is prime.
4 -> 2 * 2
2 is prime.

So 20 is 5 * 2 * 2.

## Trigonometry

Only applies to right triangles.

Sin - Opposite / Hypotenuse
Cos - Adjacent / Hypotenuse
Tan - Opposite / Adjacent

The side that comes together to make the theta angle is the adjacent side. Opposite is the opposite from theta.

To rationalize a fraction multiply by the dominator (i.e. sqrt(3)).

sin(45) = sqrt(2) / 2
cos(45) = sqrt(2) / 2
tan = 1

Because adjacement and opposite will be 45 degrees and will have a 90 degree angle, the answer will always be equal to this because the sides width/heights are the same.

For a 30-60-90 triangle. Hypotenuse is always 2x, adjacent is x, and opposite is x sqrt(3).

sin(30) = 1 / 2
cos(30) = sqrt(3) / 2
tan(30) = 1 / sqrt(3)

sin(60) = sqrt(3) / 2
cos(60) = 1 / 2
tan(60) = sqrt(3)

sec - opposite of cosine (1/cos)
csc - opposite of sin (1/sin)
cot - opposite of tan (1/tan)
